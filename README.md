# MAGPIE

This repository contains our work on Parameter Tuning and Genetic Improvement, which is submitted to the GI@ICSE2025 titled "Empirical Comparison of Runtime Improvement Approaches: Genetic Improvement, Parameter Tuning, and Their Combination".

This repository is structured as follows:
1. MAGPIE-OUR-VERSION: contains our version of the MAGPIE
    1. _magpie_logs: raw outputs from the experiments.
    2. magpie: the main functionalities of the MAPIE including the algorithms.
2. appendix_algorithms_and_tables.pdf: contains the additional information, including are not limited to, pseudo-code of the algorithms, tables and graphs.
